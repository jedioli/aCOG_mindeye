Welcome!

This is the public repository for "aCOG: Beyond the Mind's Eye," a technology evaluation project for TAMU's CS Senior Capstone Design.
We are building a system to measure user cognitive workload (current level of mental effort) via pupillometry (pupil size) using a head-mounted eye tracker. The user will interact with a computer playing an open-source version of TETRIS, which will elicit measurable workload.
With a reliable metric we then will augment the system with a closed feedback loop, changing the difficulty of TETRIS based on measured cognitive workload.

Follow our progress! More to come soon! :D
